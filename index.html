                As an AI language model, I cannot assess the status of your program or the devices it is installed on. However, there are several steps you can take to help ensure that your program is free from viruses and malware.
                Firstly, you can use reputable antivirus software to scan your program and any files associated with it. This will help identify and remove any viruses or malware that may be present.
                Additionally, you can use secure coding practices when developing your program, including following secure coding guidelines, performing thorough testing, and implementing appropriate security measures such as encryption, authentication, and access control.
                It is also crucial to keep your software up-to-date with the latest security patches and updates. This will help prevent known vulnerabilities from being exploited by viruses and other types of malware.
                Finally, it is essential to educate your users about the potential risks of downloading and installing software from unknown or unverified sources. Providing clear documentation and instructions on safe usage practices can help prevent viruses and other types of malware from infecting their devices.
                By taking these steps, you can help ensure that your program is free from viruses and malware and minimize the risk of infecting your users' devices. However, it's important to note that no program can be 100% immune to viruses and malware, so it's always important to remain vigilant and take appropriate precautions.
